Use the "help <command>" command in the browser window to view the help. You need the latest version of a web browser to use the command list. It will show you a list of all known Python commands (no quotes) and a list of what is included for any given command.  If you are new to Python you may want to start from the command list in the web browser and try the command with a new prompt.
Examples: This is just a "hello world" command that works on a standard HTML page (like the one above).  Run it with just a word processor (such as the one above) and you'll see the output at the bottom of the page.
Example 1 Run the given command with a prompt at the top of the page: curl http://pastebin.com/f5EbLWqh "hello world" Run Example 2 Run the command with a new prompt (with a -e option): python -m SimpleHTTPServer 1.2.3 --root=/dev/null --require pythondev To see the resulting HTML, choose the first command from below. The first command uses the same format as Example 2.  Example:
Run this command: curl http://pastebin.com/f5EbLWqh "hello world" Run Example 3:
This command uses a different format and it takes more than one command. To see the resulting HTML, use the command that starts with a leading underscore. The "--host" option runs in front of it to keep the result in an html tree structure.
Example: Â  Run this command with the -s option: python -m SimpleHTTPServer 1.2.3 --root=/dev/null --require pythondev To see the resulting HTML, choose the first command from the list: The first command is using the same format as Example 2.  Example:
Run this command with one or more arguments: curl http://pastebin.com/f5EbLWqh "hello world" -s example.html example Run Example 4:
This command has more arguments than the default command list above.  Run this command with a simple command-lines editor like Notepad. Note: If the interpreter window is very small, it can sometimes take several seconds for this command run to complete. 
Example: Run Example 3 again:./notepad example.html The first argument shows the command line, "
