Make sure to include all the required objects, including the < > and < > and < >, and use the helpfile to find out how to use each command. 
(You cannot use < > and < > to include a single command, but you can use <> and <> with an array of commands to include multiple commands.) 
Note: When you create a module for a MUD game, you might want to take the time to make sure that the Python code that you write for the game works with other MUDs. 
Create a module for an MUD with a cool system!
Create a module to add more than one player to a game with a theme. 
Example: 
Create a module for an MUD with a cool system and add 1 player to the game. 
The module will be called "Player A", and it will have an element of "Player 2". 
Make sure to include all the required objects including the < > and < > and < > and < >. You can use the helpfile to find out how to use each command.  Parameters included in < > are required and should be replaced by the required object or string.  Parameters included in [ ] are optional. Parameters separated by | are choices.  
(To include only the Python code, remove the brackets around the parameters.  ) 
Note: You do not need to include the brackets around the parameters when you type them. 
If you want to add more than one player then include each one in the same module. 
Example: 
Make a module that lets you make up as many characters as you want. 
Modules are for parties. 
Create a module that makes your characters available at a moment's notice. Â 
Add a module that allows you to select a character based on the character's race, gender, and class.

Create a module that lets you create characters. 
You can create up to 10 characters at a time. 
The module will be called "Player A", and it will have an element of "Player 2".
Make sure to include all the required objects including the < > and < > and < > and < >. You can use the helpfile to find out how to use each command.  Parameters include classes, races and gender, and you should replace them with the appropriate object or string.  Parameters include classes, races and gender, and
