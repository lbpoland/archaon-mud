D&D 5e Rotation:
In the MUD of Storm Silverhand (the MUD's version of D&D 5e), the game mechanics are similar to D&D, but are in fact more elaborate and fully realized (and not just because of the more powerful monsters as in D&D). There are also some very detailed mechanical changes made to the game mechanics. These include: A new system of "class" and "racial" abilities that each have specific functions. Each of these class and racial abilities have different levels and effects and have special rules that affect all of the players in the game.  These functions can be used to set up the game in new ways.  For example, a spell which causes a "bad" fight can make it very hard for the player to take the fight to the other side in the game.  A spell which makes a specific character weak for one round can make it much harder to break through a barrier to a key location. In the MUD of Storm Silverhand, most of the new features are present in the MUD as well. The only thing that is not as polished and polished as the MUD is the setting.  There are a few minor changes to the game which are all included in the MUD; but there are plenty of things that are different and not quite right here. The MUD is an MMMORPG.  This means the MUD is a system of text files that can be played in the MUD.  The files (not the game) are called.
